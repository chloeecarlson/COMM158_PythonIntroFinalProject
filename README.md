# Final Project Instructions

## Group Formation
- Students should work in **groups of 2 or 3**.
- One group member should:
  1. Click the green **"Use this template"** button.
  2. Select **"Create a new repository"**.
  3. Name it as:  
     ```
     COMM158_final_Lastname1_Lastname2_Lastname3
     ```
  4. Write the full name of all members in **Description (optional)**. 
  5. Set the repository to **Private**.
  6. Click **"Create repository"**.

- After creating the repository, that member should add their teammates and myself (TA Grace) as collaborators.

## Collaboration Guidelines
Members should first coordinate with each other to complete the project using all members' GitHub accounts. 
Make sure to keep the commit history. Do not submit the final code without the history of git commit.

## Submission Instructions
- Each group should submit **one final version**.
- Before submission:
  - **Tag a release** (e.g., `final_submission`).
  - Submit the **GitHub repository URL** on BruinLearn > Assignments > Final Project.

Good luck! ğŸš€
